# spaget
Straighten out your spaghetti tabs with this simple popup

## Hoooow?

What is the magic shortcut you ask? Easy, just press `Shift+Cmd+Space` or `Shift+Ctrl+Space` and it will appear!

## But how do it get it?

Simple! [Get it for Firefox here!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/spaget/)

Currently the extension is only published on Firefox, let me know if you want it for Chrome.
